### Materials

[Open notebook in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1c0Qw8ICTIl2yE2ChJZ4Fi6QNIoVUeWCx){.btn .btn-outline-primary .btn role="button" target=”_blank”} [View solutions](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QyVxdnwNrP1uGnsosClYsQ1hf7pF5ARF){.btn .btn-outline-primary .btn role="button" target=”_blank”}

# 0. Setup environment

## Select runtime and connect


On the top right corner of the page, click the drop-down arrow to the right of the `Connect` button and select `Change runtime type`.

![](../imgs/connect_runtime.png){width=50%}

---

Make sure `Python 3` runtime is selected. For this part of the workshop `CPU` acceleration is enough.

![](../imgs/select_runtime.png){width=50%}

---

Now we can connect to the runtime by clicking `Connect`. This will create a **V**irtual **M**achine (**VM**) with compute resources we can use for a limited amount of time.

![](../imgs/connect.png){height=25%}

:::{.callout-caution}
In free Colab accounts these resources are not guaranteed and can be taken away without notice (preemptible machines).

Data stored in this runtime will be lost if not moved into other storage when the runtime is deleted.

* Supervised

* Unsupervised

* Weakly supervised

* Reinforced

* ...

::: {.notes}
Supervised learning: teach the machine to perform a task with a set of inputs and their respective expected outcome ($X$, $Y$).

Unsupervised learning: let the machine learn to perform a task on its own ($X$) without any specific expected outcome.

Weakly supervised: teach the machine to perform a task using a limited set of expected outcomes.

Reinforced learning: let the machine learn to perform a task on its own, then give it a reward relative to its performance.

# Inputs and outputs

---

## Inputs and outputs

For a task, we want to *model* the **outcome/output** ($y$) obtained by a given **input** ($x$)

$f(x) \approx y$

::: {.callout-note}
The complete set of ($x$, $y$) pairs is known as dataset ($X$, $Y$).
:::

::: {.callout-note}
Inputs can be virtually anything, including images, texts, video, audio, electrical signals, etc.

While outputs are expected to be some meaningful piece of information, such as a category, position, value, etc.

```

- [ ] Load the CIFAR-100 dataset from torchvision.datasets

```{python}
import torch
import torchvision

cifar_ds = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR100(root="/tmp", train=True, download=True)
```

- [ ] Explore the CIFAR-100 dataset
``` {python}
x_im, y = cifar_ds[0]

len(cifar_ds), type(x_im), type(y)
```

```{python}
#| echo: false

# Introduction to PyTorch

## What is a tensor (PyTorch)?

A tensor is a multi-dimensional array. In PyTorch, this comes from a generalization of the notation of variables that exists on more than two dimensions.

*   zero-dimensional variables are points,
*   one-dimensional variables are vectors,
*   two-dimensional variables are matrices,
*   and three or more dimensional variables, are tensors.

``` {python}
import torch

x0 = torch.Tensor([7]) # This is a point

x1 = torch.Tensor([15, 64, 123]) # This is a vector

x2 = torch.Tensor([[3, 6, 5],
                   [7, 9, 12],
                   [10, 33, 1]]) # This is a matrix

x3 = torch.Tensor([[[[1, 0, 0],
                     [0, 1, 0],
                     [0, 0, 1]],
                    [[2, 0, 1],
                     [0, 2, 3],
                     [4, 1, 5]]]]) # This is a tensor
```

---

- [ ] Convert the example image `x_im` to a PyTorch tensor, and cast it to floating point data type

::: {.callout-tip}
We can use the utilities in `torchvision` to convert an image from PIL to tensor
:::

```{python}
from torchvision.transforms.v2 import PILToTensor

pre_process = PILToTensor()

x = pre_process(x_im)

x = x.float()

type(x), x.shape, x.dtype, x.min(), x.max()
```

::: {.callout-note}
For convenience, PyTorch's tensors have their channels axis before the spatial axes.
:::

---

- [ ] Create a composed transformation to carry out the conversion, casting to float, and rescaling to $[0, 1]$ range in the same function.

```{python}
from torchvision.transforms.v2 import Compose, PILToTensor, ToDtype

pre_process = Compose([
  PILToTensor(),
  ToDtype(torch.float32, scale=True)
])

x = pre_process(x_im)

type(x), x.shape, x.dtype, x.min(), x.max()
```

::: {.callout-note}
For convenience, PyTorch's tensors have their channels axis before the spatial axes.
:::

---

## Exercise: Add the preprocessing pipeline to the CIFAR-100 dataset

- [ ] Re-load the CIFAR-100 dataset, this time passing the `pre_process` function as argument.

``` {python}
cifar_ds = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR100(root="/tmp", train=True, download=True, transform=pre_process)
```

# Training, Validation, and Test data

---

## Training set

The examples ($x$, $y$) used to teach a machine/model to perform a task

---

## Validation set

Used to measure the performance of a model during training

This subset is not used for training the model, so it is *unseen* data.

::: {.notes}
This is a subset from the *training set* and can be used to test the generalization capacity of the model or to select the best configuration of a model.
:::

---

## Test set

This set of samples is **not** used when training

Its purpose is to measure the *generalization* capacity of the model

---

## Exercise: Load the test set and split the train set into train and validation subsets

- [ ] Load the CIFAR-100 test set

``` {python}
cifar_test_ds = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR100(root="/tmp", train=False, download=True, transform=pre_process)
```

- [ ] Split the training set into train and validation subsets

``` {python}
from torch.utils.data import random_split

cifar_train_ds, cifar_val_ds = random_split(cifar_ds, (40_000, 10_000))
```

# **D**eep **L**earning (**DL**) models

---

## Deep Learning (DL) models

Models that construct knowledge in a hierarchical manner are considered **deep models**.

![<a href=https://www.mdpi.com/595982>From Cervantes-Sanchez et al.</a>](https://www.mdpi.com/applsci/applsci-09-05507/article_deploy/html/images/applsci-09-05507-g003-550.jpg){height=50%}

---

## Exercise: Create a Logisic Regression model with PyTorch {.scrollable}

- [ ] Use the `nn` (Neural Networks) module from `pytorch` to create a Logistic Regression model

```{python}
import torch.nn as nn

lr_clf_1 = nn.Linear(in_features=3 * 32 * 32, out_features=100, bias=True)
lr_clf_2 = nn.Softmax()
```

- [ ] *Feed* the model with a sample `x`

::: {.callout-important}
We have to *reshape* `x` before feeding it to the model because `x` is an image with axes: Channels, Height, Width (CHW), but the Logistic Regression input should be a vector.
:::

```{python}
y_hat = lr_clf_2( lr_clf_1( x.reshape(1, -1) ))

type(y_hat), y_hat.shape, y_hat.dtype
```

---

## Exercise: Create a MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) model with PyTorch {.scrollable}

- [ ] Use the `nn.Sequential` module to build sequential models

```{python}
mlp_clf = nn.Sequential(
  nn.Linear(in_features=3 * 32 * 32, out_features=1024, bias=True),
  nn.Tanh(),
  nn.Linear(in_features=1024, out_features=100, bias=True),
  nn.Softmax()
)
```

- [ ] *Feed* the model with a sample `x`

```{python}
y_hat = mlp_clf(x.reshape(1, -1))

type(y_hat), y_hat.shape, y_hat.dtype
```

# Model optimization

---

## Model fitting/training

Models behavior depends directly on the value of their set of parameters $\theta$.

* $f(x) \approx y$
* $f_\theta(x) = y + \epsilon = \hat{y}$

::: {.callout-note}
As models increase their number of parameters, they become more *complex*
:::

**Training** is the process of optimizing the values of $\theta$

::: {.notes}
Training is often an expensive process in terms of computational resources and time.
:::

# Loss function

---

## Loss function

This is measure of the difference between the expected outputs and the predictions made by a model $L(Y, \hat{Y})$.

::: {.callout-note}
We look for *smooth* loss functions for which we can compute their gradient
:::

---

## 11.1 Loss function for regression

In the case of regression tasks we generally use the Mean Squared Error (MSE).

$MSE=\frac{1}{N}\sum \left(Y - \hat{Y}\right)^2$

---

## Loss function for classification

And for classification tasks we use the **C**ross **E**ntropy (**CE**) function.

$CE = -\frac{1}{N}\sum\limits_i^N\sum\limits_k^C y_{i,k} log(\hat{y_{i,k}})$

where $C$ is the number of classes.

::: {.callout-note}
For the binary classification case:

$BCE = -\frac{1}{N}\sum\limits_i^N \left(y_i log(\hat{y_i}) + (1 - y_i) log(1 - \hat{y_i})\right)$
:::

---

## Exercise: Define the loss function for the CIFAR-100 classification problem

- [ ] Define a Cross Entropy loss function with `nn.CrossEntropyLoss`

```{python}
loss_fun = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
```

- [ ] Remove the `nn.Softmax` layer from the MLP model.

::: {.callout-note}
According to the PyTorch documentation, the CrossEntropyLoss function takes as inputs the *logits* of the probabilities and not the probabilities themselves.
So, we don't need to *squash* the output of the MLP model.
:::

``` {python}
mlp_clf = nn.Sequential(
  nn.Linear(in_features=3 * 32 * 32, out_features=1024, bias=True),
  nn.Tanh(),
  nn.Linear(in_features=1024, out_features=100, bias=True),
  # nn.Softmax() # <- remove this line
)
```

---

## Exercise: Define the loss function for the CIFAR-100 classification problem

- [ ] Measure the prediction loss (error) of our MLP with respect to the grund-truth

::: {.callout-important}
We are using a PyTorch loss function, and it expects PyTorch's tensors as arguments, so we have to convert `y` to tensor before computing the loss function.
:::

``` {python}
loss = loss_fun(y_hat, torch.LongTensor([y]))

loss
```

# Gradient based optimization

---

## Gradient based optimization

*Gradient*-based methods are able to fit large numbers of parameters when using a *smooth* Loss function as target.

::: {.callout-note}
We compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to the model parameters using the chain rule from calculous.
Generally, this is managed by the machine learning packages such as PyTorch and Tensorflow with a method called *back propagation*.
:::

### **Gradient Descent**

* $\theta^{t+1} = \theta^t - \eta \nabla_\theta L(Y, \hat{Y})$

---

## Exercise: Compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters of the MLP.

- [ ] Check what are the gradients of the MLP parameters before back propagating the gradient.

``` {python}
mlp_clf[0].bias.grad
```

- [ ] Compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to the MLP parameters.

::: {.callout-note}
To *back propagate* the gradients we use the `loss.backward()` method of the loss function.
:::

``` {python}
loss = loss_fun(y_hat, torch.LongTensor([y]))

loss.backward()
```

- [ ] Verify that the gradients have been propagated to the model parameters.

``` {python}
mlp_clf[0].bias.grad
```

---

## Stochastic methods

::: {.callout-caution}
The Gradient descent method require to obtain the Loss function for the whole training set before doing a single update.

This can be inefficient when large volumes of data are used for training the model.
:::

* These methods use a relative small sample from the training data called *mini-batch* at a time.

* This reduces the amount of memory used for computing intermediate operations carried out during optimization process.

---

## **S**tochastic **G**radient **D**escent (**SGD**)

::: {.notes}
This strategy defines $\theta$'s' update rule for iteration $t+1$ using a *mini-batch* sampled at random from the training set as follows.
:::

* $\theta^{t+1} = \theta^t - \eta \nabla_\theta L(Y_{b}, \hat{Y_{b}})$

* $\eta$ controls the update we perform on the current parameter's values

::: {.callout-note}
This parameter in Deep Learning is known as the **learning rate**
:::

---

## Training with mini-batches

::: {.callout-note}
PyTorch can operate efficiently on multiple inputs at the same time.
To do that, we can use a `DataLoader` to serve mini-batches of inputs.
:::

---

## Exercise: Train the MLP classifier

- [ ] Use a `DataLoader` to serve mini-batches of images to train our MLP.

``` {python}
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

cifar_train_dl = DataLoader(cifar_train_ds, batch_size=128, shuffle=True)
cifar_val_dl = DataLoader(cifar_val_ds, batch_size=256)
cifar_test_dl = DataLoader(cifar_test_ds, batch_size=256)
```

- [ ] Create a Stochastic Gradient Descent optimizer for our MLP classifier.

```{python}
import torch.optim as optim

optimizer = optim.SGD(mlp_clf.parameters(), lr=0.01, )
```

---

## Exercise: Train the MLP classifier {.scrollable}

- [ ] Implement the *training-loop* to fit the parameters of our MLP classifier.

::: {.callout-note}
Gradients are accumulated on every iteration, so we need to reset the accumulator with `optimizer.zero_grad()` for every new batch.
:::

::: {.callout-note}
To perform get the new iteration's parameter values $\theta^{t+1}$ we use `optimizer.step()` to compute the update step.
:::

```{.python code-line-numbers="|3|9|11"}
mlp_clf.train()
for x, y in cifar_train_dl:
  optimizer.zero_grad()

  y_hat = mlp_clf( x.reshape(-1, 3 * 32 * 32) ) # Reshape it into a batch of vectors

  loss = loss_fun(y_hat, y)

  loss.backward()

  optimizer.step()
```
```{python}
#| echo: false
mlp_clf.train()
for x, y in cifar_train_dl:
  optimizer.zero_grad()

  y_hat = mlp_clf( x.reshape(-1, 3 * 32 * 32) ) # Reshape it into a batch of vectors

  loss = loss_fun(y_hat, y)

  loss.backward()

  optimizer.step()
```

---

## Exercise: Train the MLP classifier and track the training and validation loss

- [ ] Save the loss function of each batch and the overall average loss during training.

::: {.callout-note}
To extract the loss function's value without anything else attached use `loss.item()`.
:::

```{.python code-line-numbers="1-3,13-15,21"}
train_loss = []
train_loss_avg = 0
total_train_samples = 0

mlp_clf.train()
for x, y in cifar_train_dl:
  optimizer.zero_grad()

  y_hat = mlp_clf( x.reshape(-1, 3 * 32 * 32) ) # Reshape it into a batch of vectors

  loss = loss_fun(y_hat, y)

  train_loss.append(loss.item())
  train_loss_avg += loss.item() * len(x)
  total_train_samples += len(x)

  loss.backward()

  optimizer.step()

train_loss_avg /= total_train_samples
```
```{python}
#| echo: false
train_loss = []
train_loss_avg = 0
total_train_samples = 0

mlp_clf.train()
for x, y in cifar_train_dl:
  optimizer.zero_grad()

  y_hat = mlp_clf( x.reshape(-1, 3 * 32 * 32) ) # Reshape it into a batch of vectors

  loss = loss_fun(y_hat, y)

  train_loss.append(loss.item())
  train_loss_avg += loss.item() * len(x)
  total_train_samples += len(x)

  loss.backward()

  optimizer.step()

train_loss_avg /= total_train_samples
```

---

## Exercise: Train the MLP classifier and track the training and validation loss
- [ ] Compute the average loss function for the validation set.

::: {.callout-note}
Because we don't train the model with the validation set, back-propagation and optimization steps are not needed.

Additionally, we wrap the loop `with torch.no_grad()` to prevent the generation of gradients that could fill the memory unnecessarily.
:::

``` {.python code-line-numbers="|5"}
val_loss_avg = 0
total_val_samples = 0

mlp_clf.eval()
with torch.no_grad():
  for x, y in cifar_val_dl:
    y_hat = mlp_clf( x.reshape(-1, 3 * 32 * 32) ) # Reshape it into a batch of vectors
    loss = loss_fun(y_hat, y)

    val_loss_avg += loss.item() * len(x)
    total_val_samples += len(x)

val_loss_avg /= total_val_samples
```
``` {python}
#| echo: false
val_loss_avg = 0
total_val_samples = 0

mlp_clf.eval()
with torch.no_grad():
  for x, y in cifar_val_dl:
    y_hat = mlp_clf( x.reshape(-1, 3 * 32 * 32) ) # Reshape it into a batch of vectors
    loss = loss_fun(y_hat, y)

    val_loss_avg += loss.item() * len(x)
    total_val_samples += len(x)

val_loss_avg /= total_val_samples
```

- [ ] Plot the training loss for this *epoch*.

``` {python}

plt.plot([0, len(train_loss)], [train_loss_avg, train_loss_avg], "r:", label="Average training loss")

# Performance metrics

## Performance metrics

Used to measure how good or bad a model carries out a task

* $f(x) \approx y$

* $f(x) = y + \epsilon = \hat{y}$

::: {.notes}
Given the set of parameters, as well as other factors, the output of a model can deviate from the expected outcome. So, the actual output of a model is $f(x) = \hat{y}$.
:::

::: {.callout-note}
The output $\hat{y}$ is called **prediction ** given the context taken from statistical regression analysis.

## Convolution layers

The most common operation in DL models for image processing are Convolution operations.

![2D Convolution](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Convolution_arithmetic_-_Full_padding_no_strides_transposed.gif)

The animation shows the convolution of a 7x7 pixels input image (bottom) with a 3x3 pixels kernel (moving window), that results in a 5x5 pixels output (top).

---

## Exercise: Visualize the effect of the convolution operation

- [ ] Create a convolution layer with `nn.Conv2D` using 3 channels as input, and a single one for output.

``` {python}
conv_1 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=1, kernel_size=7, padding=0, bias=True)

x, _ = next(iter(cifar_train_dl))

fx = conv_1(x)

type(fx), fx.dtype, fx.shape, fx.min(), fx.max()
```

::: {.callout-warning}
The convolution layer is initialized with random values, so the results will vary.

## Exercise: Visualize the effect of the convolution operation

- [ ] Create a convolution layer with `nn.Conv2D` using 3 channels as input, and a single one for output.

``` {python}
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = [5, 5]

fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2)
ax[0].imshow(x[0].permute(1, 2, 0))
ax[1].imshow(fx.detach()[0, 0], cmap="gray")
plt.show()
```

::: {.callout-important}
By default, outputs from PyTorch modules are tracked for back-propagation.

To visualize it with `matplotlib` we have to `.detach()` the tensor first.

ax[0, 0].imshow(conv_1.weight.detach()[0, 0], cmap="gray")
ax[0, 1].imshow(conv_1.weight.detach()[0, 1], cmap="gray")
ax[1, 0].imshow(conv_1.weight.detach()[0, 2], cmap="gray")
ax[1, 1].set_axis_off()
plt.show()
```

conv_1.weight.data[:] = torch.FloatTensor([
  [
    [
      [0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0],

      [0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0],
    ],
  ]
])
